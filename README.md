# Hello There

My name is Allison Leon. I am a fourth year majoring in **Public Policy** with a minor in _Human Rights_. I am originally from *Chicago* and grew up in the **Back of the Yards neighborhood**. I have had experience with R in the past, as it is almost a requirement to familiarize yourself with it for the PubPol major. However, I always felt that those courses brushed through R too quickly, and I wanted to really understand and be able to use R for myself and future work. I am excited to be frustrated by this course, as this first assignment already proved!

Here are a few more facts about me
* I am Guatemalan
* I have two younger sisters
* I find it easiest to study while listening to [instrumental metal music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPSWsz2R6Xc&t=2857s&ab_channel=Dorkly)
* I have a dog named Monch (pictured below)

## Reflecting on HW01

At first I was having a lot of difficulty with this assignment. I initially forked and copied the assignment into my repository with litte issue and tried running a few tests but I realized that I couldn't push anything to the repository. After looking around Stackflow for help, I turned to the Issues tab where Professor Soltof advised that I just make another copy of the repository on my computer, which I did. This helped and after making sure that I had indeed installed everything correctly and rewatching the homework flow video for the fifth time I was able to successfully format and push onto Github. I used [this guide](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/writing-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) to cover some basic formatting on Github. I found Markdown pretty easy to use for basic formatting, but I had trouble with resizing my image. I tried a few different formats for that but none of them seemed to work and all of them resulted in the code showing up next to the image on Github. Otherwise, everything else felt straightforward once I figured how to stage, commit, and push on Git. 

## My WOrk Proces

* Fork repository from the class account.
* Make a copy of the repository and create a project in RStudio. 
* Write a test line and try to stage, commit, and push it in RStudio.
* Create headings for what I would be writing
* Write lines for assignment while saving and committing each time a chunk was added.
* Create small list and embed links
* Add in image.
